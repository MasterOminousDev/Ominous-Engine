# More Information on Contributing to the Engine

## Branches
`master` is the repository's main branch, but people need clone a stable Ominous Engine to work on their mods so I am focusing on making the engine stable. However, this means that Pull Requests will default to merge into
`master` instead of `stable`. (there is no stable branch lol jokes on you :))

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER.


This really took this long to document. Ask KadeDev or something
